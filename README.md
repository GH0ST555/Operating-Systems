# Operating-Systems
This repo contains the malloc and free implementation in the XV6 operating system using the C coding language.
The malloc and free functions were created specifically for the xv6 OS.
It uses a struct to hold pointer information of all blocks. It uses the Best-Fit approach where blocks of data are specifically used for efficiency.
